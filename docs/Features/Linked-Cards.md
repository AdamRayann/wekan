Linked Card feature was added at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1592

With Linked Card feature, it's possible to create new board as dashboard, and link cards from other boards to current board, seeing realtimes changes from all those cards at dashboard.

Search is for searching card, to be as linked card, I presume.

There is also Linked Board, but I'm not sure is it useful.
